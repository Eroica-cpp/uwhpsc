Bitbucket repositories: viewing changesets, issue tracking
=============================================================

The directions in Section :ref:`git` explain how to use the class Bitbucket
repository to download these class notes and other resources used in the
class, and also how to set up your own repository there.

See also `Bitbucket 101
<https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101>`_.

In addition to providing a hosting site for repositories to allow them to be
easily shared, Bitbucket provides other web-based resources for working with
a repository.  (So do other sites such as 
`github <http://github.com/repositories>`_, for
example.)

To get a feel for what's possible, take a look at one of the major software
projects hosted on bitbucket, for example
`<http://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/>`_ which is the repository for the
Sphinx software used for these class notes pages (see :ref:`sphinx`).  You
will see that software is being actively developed.  

If you click on the "Source" tab at the top of the page you can browse
through the source code repository in its current state.

If you click on the "Changesets" tab you can see all the changes ever
committed, with the message that was written following the -m flag when the
commit was made.  If you click on one of these messages, it will show all
the changes in the form of the lines of the files changed, highlighted in
green for things added or red for things deleted.

If you click on the "Issues" tab, you will see the issue-tracking page.  If
someone notices a bug that should be fixed, or thinks of an improvement that
should be made, a new issue can be created (called a "ticket" in some systems).

If you want to try creating a ticket, **don't** do it on the Sphinx page,
the developers won't appreciate it.  Instead try doing it on your own
bitbucket repository that you set up following :ref:`myhg`.

You might also want to look at the bitbucket page for this class repository,
at `<http://bitbucket.org/rjleveque/uwamath583s13/>`_ to keep track
of changes made to notes or code available.
